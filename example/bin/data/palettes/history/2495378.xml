    <description>one of the twenty-five haystacks pieces&#x0A;&#x0A;Haystacks is a title of a series of impressionist paintings by Claude Monet. The primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of hay in the field after the harvest season. The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) begun in the end of summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year&apos;s harvest. Some use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same theme. The series is known for its thematic use of repetition to show differences in perception of light across various times of day, seasons, and types of weather. The subjects were painted in fields near Monet&apos;s home in Giverny, France.&#x0A;&#x0A;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: CENTER;&quot;&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.colourlovers.com/group/Artist_of_Nature&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG style=&quot; WIDTH:68%&quot; class=&quot;photo-border&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/okKMW.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
