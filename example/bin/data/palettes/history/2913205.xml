    <description>&lt;b&gt;She&apos;s Leaving Home&lt;/b&gt;&#x0A;Lennon/McCartney&#x0A;&#x0A;Wednesday morning at five o&apos;clock &#x0A;As the day begins &#x0A;Silently closing her bedroom door &#x0A;Leaving the note that she hoped would say more &#x0A;&#x0A;She goes downstairs to the kitchen &#x0A;Clutching her handkerchief &#x0A;Quietly turning the backdoor key &#x0A;Stepping outside, she is free &#x0A;&#x0A;She...(we gave her most of our lives) &#x0A;Is leaving (sacrified most of our lives) &#x0A;Home (we gave her everything money could buy) &#x0A;She&apos;s leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye) &#x0A;&#x0A;Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown &#x0A;Picks up the letter that&apos;s lying there &#x0A;Standing alone at the top of the stairs &#x0A;She breaks down and cries to her husband &#x0A;&quot;Daddy, our baby&apos;s gone. &#x0A;&quot;Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly? &#x0A;How could she do this to me?&quot; &#x0A;&#x0A;She...(we never thought of ourselves) &#x0A;Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves) &#x0A;Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by) &#x0A;She&apos;s leaving home, after living alone, for so many years &#x0A;&#x0A;Friday morning, at nine o&apos;clock &#x0A;She is far away &#x0A;Waiting to keep the appointment she made &#x0A;Meeting a man from the Motortrade &#x0A;&#x0A;She (what did we do that was wrong) &#x0A;Is Having (we didn&apos;t know it was wrong) &#x0A;Fun (fun is the one thing that money can&apos;t buy) &#x0A;&#x0A;Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years... &#x0A;She&apos;s leaving home...bye, bye.&#x0A;&#x0A;￼Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC</description>
