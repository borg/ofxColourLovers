    <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colourlovers.com/group/Its_All_About_Me/conversations/17046/ME17:_Moments_That_Made_Me&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH:100%&quot; src=&quot;http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h370/luna_rose/momentsmade.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#x0A;&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;living alone&lt;/strong&gt;. While in most countries it&apos;s perfectly normal for young people to spread their wings as soon as they can, in Italy family bonds are much tighter and we tend to leave our parents around age 30. Even if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to emancipate yourself, banks don&apos;t invest on you and getting a permanent job is very hard. You can always try to go abroad, though...which is what I did last year, even if for just a few months. I had a few savings and a little bonus from the insititution that helped me finding a job in Spain, and I knew that I had to make them last until the end, for my father had been very clear about the fact that he wouldn&apos;t help me out. I managed to do so and even had enough money left to pay all my little sister&apos;s expenses when she came to visit me at the end of my stay, including the flight.  Was it hard? Well, a little, and not only on economical terms. But I would do it again and probably will when I manage to save a little more.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;driving licence&lt;/strong&gt;. When I was studying to get mine I discovered I suffered from amaxophobia, a.k.a. the fear of driving, but I needed that licence so bad I had to overcome it at any cost. And I did.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;mom went to india&lt;/strong&gt;. I&apos;m afraid it will take a while, so please try to bear with me.&#x0A;When I was 15 my mother abandoned the family and went to India, where the man she was hoping to have a new start with lived. This man was her first love, who she had never forgotten despite dating - and later marrying - someone else. He knew she had four kids, the youngest being only 12, yet encouraged her to join him anyway. {Oh, did I mention he was a member of the former Children Of God and that joining him meant joining them?}&#x0A;None of us saw it coming: we knew she wasn&apos;t satisfied with her married life, but we didn&apos;t think she was &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; desperate - and let me tell you this, it&apos;s not funny AT ALL to realize that your mother only lives with you because she has nowhere else to go. In the end her lover understood that, no matter how miserable she felt with us, he had no right to separate her from her own flesh and blood, and sent her back after two months. During that time she would call us and talk about the happy life she was having in India until we couldn&apos;t take it anymore. She just didn&apos;t seem to get how painful it was for us to hear such words. Dealing with her return was much worse than dealing with her absence, for we knew too well that she would have never come back had dependend on her. That&apos;s why I think my adolescence ended during those two months.&#x0A;{For the record, it&apos;s been 7 years now. Things have smoothed a little, but my mother still dreams of a different life and we know it. Still she is our mother and we are her children, so let us say we all do our best to cope with it.}&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;fight to death&lt;/strong&gt;. Or rather fight &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; death. You see, I was born with a tangled umbilical cord. The knot was so big and tight I was chockig to death, but fortunately it was cut before it was too late. I don&apos;t remember any of it, of course, but somehow I feel that this brief yet crucial struggle is engraved in my heart: literally a born fighter!&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;high school memory&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn&apos;t have a very good time in high school,  yet I&apos;m grateful to the people who made me suffer because thanks to them I know exactly how I don&apos;t want to become as an adult. The turning point occurred during my fourth year - here in Italy we have 5 - when not only my classmates, but even the teachers, whith whom I always had a wonderful understanding, turned their back on me. I graduated the following year as an external student in the very same school which had rejected me with very satisfying results, a decision I&apos;ll never regret.&#x0A;&#x0A;{Sorry about all the mistakes I&apos;ve been scattering around. It&apos;s not easy to lay bare such intimate things in a language which is not yours.}</description>
