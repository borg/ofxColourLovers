    <description>What makes this painting worthy of commemoration? Is this BEFORE the acrylic color faded, or AFTER? The Wall Street Journal complained that Rothko&apos;s acrylic colors weren&apos;t painted to last more than several years, unlike the classic oils. I don&apos;t get it. These colors were copied from the illustration, so don&apos;t blame me.&#x0A;&#x0A;United States Postal Service considered the most important American Paintings in the last 300 years. Apparently THIS is art worth paying for. Mark Rothko named it &quot;Number 12&quot;. Would I go to a museum to see this? Maybe I already have. I couldn&apos;t tell whether it was hung on an outside section of a decayed wall. Maybe.&#x0A;&#x0A;Use Image:&#x0A;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.colourlovers.com/images/palettes/75/75379u.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;</description>
