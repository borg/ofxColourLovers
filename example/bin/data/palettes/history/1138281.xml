    <description>&lt;strong&gt;There are still believes, that it is possible to have secrets while the information of wealth is saved on bank servers. Or worse,  any other server: county, state, company; you name it. Especially, if the bank or organization an agreement has with its state.&#x0A;In 2010, Switzerland cashed 4.7 billion, 4 700 000 000.00 Swiss Francs, withholding tax on interest and dividends according to the Berner Zeitung. That is 35% of the interest that the undeclared wealth triggered. Bare in mind, that the interest rates are fairly low at the moment, dividends vary: from naught to not bad. Anyone, who researches can find out how much is declared and how much is not. Thus, with that state agreement the banks have exposed their clients and themselves and nobody else. The introduction of the withholding tax was the beginning of the end.&#x0A;Neither the Americans nor the Germans need to buy any cd of any whistle blower, except to protect their own trumpet players. For the USA and Germany, not only these, get the information via the revenues which the secret wealth generates.&#x0A;Thus, the spectacle around WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, Julius Baer Bank, Rudolf Elmer, UBS, CS, the Indian uproar is amateur comedy as usual. The data which Rudolf Elmer, a former Cayman Islands usher with director ranking, gave Julian Paul Assange, WikiLeaks, in London earlier this year, 2011, has been published by Wall Street Journal in the year 2005. Moreover, any informed individual knows more than both with their whole network. Therefore, the data is as news breaking as The 2005 Oscars.&#x0A;Both, Assange and Elmer are only false faces. A marketing campaign staged by data dealers of any shade. Both are harassed with third class slander, which still functions. Elmer is not even sued for breaking secrecy laws. As any Swiss police woMAN knows more than Elmer. Moreover, it would be easy to sue Elmer for breaking his contract, as his contract on that point does not expire. An usher, ranked director like him, has to shut up about the information he received due to his position. &#x0A;He is sued for theft. He stole outdated data. True.&#x0A;For forgery. True. He updated the documents with his speculations and the wrong data of his suppliers. Which dealerESS tells you his / her insider knowledge. sHE would be quickly out of business. Any escort, lady or gentleman, has more accurate news than Elmer ever had.&#x0A;Thirdly for harassing people. He could not handle the awakening. The informed know more than Elmer. The rest what the ... do they care. Now, he should know.&#x0A;He is sued to cause a scandal. To create rumor as jumbo as possible. Meanwhile, the legal / illegal data dealers quickly plot their golden deals. Old established tactics. Whenever, a whistle blows, whatever the name, Elmer or Assange, yes, Assange is just a little more a whistle blower, an open source whistle blower, a whistle blower just as the data dealers official / inofficial. The difference is,  they sell, he does give free access, which you can support with donations. Their nets are less known. Assange`s net is more open. &#x0A;The trumpets play quickly during the screening of the false faces. Another difference at the moment is, they can sell comfortably. All the data, which Germany, the USA and others have, is due to Assange, Elmer or some other false face, should they been asked about their source.&#x0A;What have whistle blowers in common? They want to be an immense influence. They want the cultures to be like their outdated data. They want to chase those, whom they hate. They want their simple views to be law. What they do not want, is analysis and change. &#x0A;One example: if you do not want illegal drug money in the legal money circle, legalize drugs. The profits made with drugs cannot be declared, however, the drug industry uses the services of the financial casino.&#x0A;Never trust a bank or a banker. Nor the state, as the state has outsourced the gathering of information. They are labelled data, media, consulting, help and so on.&#x0A;Data firms do have access to the provider`s most updated technology. They are trained by the providers. Moreover, data dealing generates as much revenue as the drug industry. Easy to hire both technology and woMEN.&#x0A;&#x0A;green blush | green shade | #E7EDEA | RGB 231/237/234 | HSV 150/3/93 | CMYK 3/0/1/7 | avilluk 9552 ||&#x0A;spring warmth | orange shade | #FFC52C | RGB 255/197/44 | HSV 44/83/100 | CMYK 0/23/83/0 | avilluk 3458 ||&#x0A;joy | red shade | #FB0C06 | RGB 251/12/6 | HSV 1/98/98 | CMYK 0/95/98/2 | avilluk 9540 ||&#x0A;dawn | blue shade | #030D4F | RGB 3/13/79 | HSV 232/96/31 | CMYK 96/84/0/69 | avilluk 7 ||&#x0A;avilluk [avilluk ljd (lukas jakob david) leu] s birthday | cyan shade | #CEECEF | RGB 206/236/239 | HSV 185/14/94 | CMYK 14/1/0/6 | avilluk 9553 ||&#x0A;confidential | avilluk 729 com | avilluk ljd leu | 28 jan 11 | 05:05 h | basel switzerland ||&#x0A;&#x0A;political color click link&lt;/strong&gt;</description>
