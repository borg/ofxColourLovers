They called me &quot;The Shark&quot; when I was younger - my baby teeth wouldn&apos;t fall off, while my permanent ones were already on their way. So you see, I had way more teeth than needed and absolutely no room for a good half of  them.  I had to have them removed by force and then it took a lot of time, money and pain to rearrange my devastated mouth. How do you hide it from other people? It&apos;s not like you can keep quiet forever, and trust me, the more you try to conceal it the more people notice. Now I&apos;m 22 and my dentist says that my perfectly straight teeth are his own masterpiece.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;2) writing a novel&lt;/strong&gt;.  I&apos;ve been writing novels since I was 13...in my head. Someday I will be ready to share at least one of them with the world, ad it will be awesome - if not the novel itsfelf, the very same act of bringing it to real life.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;3) watership down&lt;/strong&gt;. A book about bunnies. I love these animals with all my might - but never had one because my parent&apos;s wouldn&apos;t let me.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;4) ice queen&lt;/strong&gt;.Just because at time I don&apos;t know how to show that I care it doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;5) waterworks&lt;/strong&gt;.  I was an overly sensitive child and my teacher used to say that I reminded her of a water tap. Although she didn&apos;t want to offend me I usually ended up crying even more.&#x0A;&#x0A;EDIT: oh right, I almost forgot - Psycho Jello, Acitauca &amp; sugary, I tagged you :P</description>
