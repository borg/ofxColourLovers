    <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.colourlovers.com/group/Its_All_About_Me/conversations/17135/ME20:_Treasures_I_Treasure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH:100%&quot; src=&quot;http://i1106.photobucket.com/albums/h370/luna_rose/treasures.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#x0A;&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;pink rabbit&lt;/strong&gt;. It&apos;s actually a dog with a pink rabbit disguise, but still. Being the third of four kids I didn&apos;t have many chances to get brand new toys - I was fine with my brother and sister&apos;s &quot;leftovers&quot;, but it feel so nice when you&apos;re given something nobody else has ever had before - and Piccirillo {meaning &quot;Little one&quot;} is one of these few sacred objects. I&apos;m not really into pelouches, but this one is with me since I was 4. I actually considered to bring it with me when I went to live abroad for a while, but I had to leave it at home because it wouldn&apos;t enter in the suitcase.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;reindeer&lt;/strong&gt;. Oddurn and is a rag reindeer I bought in Norway. I was 16 and it was the first time I ever went abroad - I had to represent my school at an international meeting - and I wanted something to remind me forever of the wonderful time I had spent there.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;opals 6&lt;/strong&gt;. My aunt from my father&apos;s side used to paint and carve for a living, then had to become a clerk to support herself once leaving the family. Our relationship is a bit discontinued, but she once made me an opal pendant which has become one of my favourite jewels.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;library gem&lt;/strong&gt;. I love every book I have in my library. They are the closest thing to children I&apos;ve ever had.&#x0A;&lt;strong&gt;send a postcard&lt;/strong&gt;. I actually buy more postcards for myself than for other people. I like staring at them and letting memories run free. Right now on the wall in behind my desk there are some I purchased at Munch&apos;s Museum during the aforementioned trip to Norway and some Valencian views, but I have many more in my drawers. Among them there are also the ones my best friend used to send me when we were kids and she spent her summers visiting Europe with her parents. My family couldn&apos;t afford to go on holiday, so by reading them I almost felt like I was there with her.</description>
